      <h2> SMART Goal</h2> 

      <p> <img class = "body" src ="images/Design.jpg">  My SMART Goal, that I set in this fall, was to improve my grammar in my writing pieces. I've been acheiving this goal through both reading and annotating many various classic novels, such as Pride and Prejudice and the Catcher in The Rye. By reading these novels I've been able to find new ways to make my writing more interesting through grammar. Additionally, for the remainder of this year, in my writing assignments, I will try to nuse the new grammar i've learned to improve my writing and make it more enticing. And furthermore, I will have my siblings look over my work, to tell me how the essay/other writing assignments hold up to high school standard.

      <p><img class = "body" src ="images/Design.jpg"> In the begining of this year, I set my strength as essay writing, and I'm happy to say it remains a strength. An example of this is my Scarlet Letter essay, as I was very proud of my grade. And additionally, I've still been trying to improve my essay writing by continually writing even out of school. And in my other essays, I've also received many other grades that I was happy with. And through this I still believe essay writing is still one of my greatest strengths. </p>
      <h2> Stretch </h2>
      <p> <img class = "body" src ="images/Design.jpg">The stretch I had in the fall was collaboration, and sadly, it still is my stretch. This stretch effects me the most in group projects because, to simply put it, I find it very difficult to communicate my ideas. Over the course of the year I still have not found myself comfortable with talking in groups. Either, I take over the group because I am not trustful of my fellow classmates to do the work. I find this very problematic, as in highschool group projects are very common. I hope to overcome this stretch, and perhaps, through hard work, make it a strength </p>

      <h2>Mid-year Reflection Questions</h2>
      <ol> <li> <p> I believe my friend group is both accpecting and broad, as we try to be kind to our fellow classmates. However, something to improve on is including younger students in our social events more often.</p></li>
          <li><p>Outside of school I've been involved in different volunteering, such as at the library, animal shelter, and at local events. Additionally, I joined an organization, vcalled 4-h, that strives to teach ypoung kids leadership skills.</p></li>
          <li><p>If I am not sick, or out of town, i will always turn in my assignments on time.However, I have a nasty habit of procrastinating, cause although I turn my assognment in on time, I have bad time management.</p></li></ol>
